# Nanowire_Neural_Networks
This is an implementation of the concept of Nanowire neural networks used for time series processing, given in the paper: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=TM9xxxLhtO

We have experimented with 6 datasets, 4 for classification and 2 for regression. The algorithms have been run on these 6 datasets to get an idea of their comparative performance

A report and a presentation on this topic are also attached here, to get an idea about how we approached the implementation, what issues we faced and the conclusions we drew about the efficacy of Nanowire Neural Networks for time-series processing vis-a-vis regular approaches like RNN.
